## Title: Large Language Models (LLMs) and their Impact on Education

## Abstract:

In this panel discussion, academics will explore the significant impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) on modern-day education. From redefining the assessment of student writing to reshaping the nature of composition, LLMs have sparked a paradigm shift in educational practices. LLMs have also enabled new opportunities in content creation, interactive tutoring, and personalization. The panelists will discuss how LLMs are altering the landscape of education in schools, online education, self-directed learning settings, and high-stakes assessments. This panel will allow attendees to understand the challenges and ethical considerations of integrating LLMs in educational settings.
Key questions that the panelist will discuss:
- How LLMs affect high-stake and student writing assessment
- How LLMs change writing
- How LLMs enable new forms of educational applications
- How LLMs affect educational outcomes
- ​​How LLMs impact plagiarism detection
