All posters will be considered in full color. The price does not change if design is in black and white.

The file submitted for printing needs to cover these specs:

- File in PDF format
- Final arts at 100% of printing size

Due to the expected load of work for this event, we cannot make any changes of any part of the posters you send as final art. 
We will execute a process called 'preflight' before printing, to review and fix the most common mistakes on files, 
such as RGB color scheme, sizing, margins; 
but we cannot take responsibility for the final result of the poster if it does not come with the right specifications.

### Delivery 

Files will be printed as they are delivered on a first come first served basis. 
Posters can be picked at the Registration Solutions Desk located on Level 2 outside of Don Am√©rico.
