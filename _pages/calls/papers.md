NAACL 2024 invites the submission of long and short papers featuring substantial, original, and unpublished research in all aspects of Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing. NAACL 2024 has a goal of a diverse technical program—in addition to traditional research results, papers may contribute negative findings, survey an area, announce the creation of a new resource, argue a position, report novel linguistic insights derived using existing computational techniques, and reproduce, or fail to reproduce, previous results.

As in recent years, some of the presentations at the conference will be of papers accepted by the Transactions of the ACL (TACL) and the Computational Linguistics (CL) journals.

**Paper Submission Information**

<!-- Papers must be submitted on ARR’s December 2023 cycle using the following link: -->

<!-- [https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/ARR/2023/December](https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/ARR/2023/December) -->

Papers may be submitted to the ARR 2023 December cycle using the following link: 

[https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/ARR/2023/December](https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/ARR/2023/December).

Papers that have received reviews and a meta-review from ARR (whether from the ARR 2023 December cycle or an earlier ARR cycle) may be committed to NAACL using the following link: 

[https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/NAACL/2024/Conference](https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/NAACL/2024/Conference).

<!-- Papers submitted to one of the earlier ARR deadlines are also eligible, and it is not necessary to (re) submit on the current cycle. -->

**Submission Topic**

NAACL 2024 aims to have a broad technical program. Relevant topics for the conference include, but are not limited to, the following areas:



* Computational Social Science and Cultural Analytics

* **Special Theme:** Languages of Latin America

**NAACL 2024 Theme Track: “Languages of Latin America”**

This is an exciting opportunity to explore and showcase the rich linguistic diversity of the region. Please refer to the blogpost "[Languages of Latin America](https://2024.naacl.org/blog/NAACL-2024-Theme-Track-Languages-of-Latin-America/)" for a detailed description of the topic and scope. We hope to receive innovative and insightful research papers that contribute to advancing computational linguistics in Latin America.

**Two Stage Review: Submission to ARR, Commitment to NAACL**

NAACL 2024 will use [ACL Rolling Review](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp) (ARR) as a reviewing system, but final decisions will be made by the conference. Both submissions of articles for review and commitment of reviewed articles to the conference will be performed via the [Open Review](https://openreview.net) platform. Specifically, authors will follow a two-step process:



1. Authors submit articles to ARR, where submissions receive reviews and meta-reviews from ARR reviewers and action editors;
2. Authors commit their reviewed articles to a publication venue (e.g., NAACL 2024), where Senior Area Chairs and Program Chairs make acceptance decisions from the ARR reviews and meta-reviews.

NAACL 2024 has chosen this approach in coordination with the other *ACL 2024 conferences, which are adopting the same procedure and a coordinated submission plan to allow maximum flexibility during their submission periods for the authors. At each cycle, an author must choose whether to have their paper under review at ARR, or committed to a conference. So for example, a paper submitted to ARR on 15 Dec 2023 cannot also be committed to EACL on their commitment deadline of 20 Dec 2023, but it could be either re-submitted to ARR on 15 Feb 2024 or committed to NAACL on 20 Feb 2024. 

The reviewing process will continue to be double-blind. Reviewers will not see authors, nor will authors see reviewers and reviews on ARR will not be made publicly visible. However, authors will be given the option through ARR to make their anonymized submitted articles publicly visible.

Following the [ACL and ARR policies](https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/report-acl-committee-anonymity-policy), there is an anonymity period for submissions to ARR 2023 December but no anonymity period for commitments to NAACL 2024.

At the time of submission to ARR, authors will be asked to select a preferred venue (e.g., ACL 2024, NAACL 2024). This is used only to calculate acceptance rates. Authors who selected NAACL 2024 as a preferred venue when submitting to ARR may choose not to commit to NAACL 2024 after receiving their reviews, and authors who selected a preferred venue other than NAACL 2024 when submitting to ARR are still welcome to commit to NAACL 2024.

Both long and short paper submissions should follow all of the [ARR submission requirements](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#paper-submission-information), including:

**Presentation at the Conference**

All accepted papers must be presented at the conference to appear in the proceedings. The conference will include both in-person and virtual presentation options. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for NAACL 2024 by the early registration deadline.

Long and short papers will be presented orally or as posters as determined by the program committee. While short papers will be distinguished from long papers in the proceedings, there will be no distinction in the proceedings between papers presented orally and papers presented as posters.
