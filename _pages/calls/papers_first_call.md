NAACL 2024 invites the submission of long and short papers featuring substantial, original, and unpublished research in all aspects of Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing. 
NAACL 2024 has a goal of a diverse technical program—in addition to traditional research results, papers may contribute negative findings, survey an area, announce the creation of a new resource, argue a position, report novel linguistic insights derived using existing computational techniques, and reproduce, or fail to reproduce, previous results.

As in recent years, some of the presentations at the conference will be of papers accepted by the Transactions of the ACL (TACL) and the Computational Linguistics (CL) journals.

## Submission Topics

NAACL 2024 aims to have a broad technical program. Relevant topics for the conference include, but are not limited to, the following areas:

* Computational Social Science and Cultural Analytics
* Dialogue and Interactive Systems
* Discourse and Pragmatics
* Efficient/Low-resource Methods for NLP
* Ethics, Bias, and Fairness
* Generation
* Information Extraction
* Information Retrieval and Text Mining
* Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP
* Linguistic theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics
* Machine Learning for NLP
* Machine Translation
* Multilinguality and Language Diversity
* Multimodality and Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond
* Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation
* Question Answering
* Resources and Evaluation
* Semantics: Lexical
* Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas
* Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining
* Speech recognition, text-to-speech and spoken language understanding
* Summarization
* Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing / ML
* NLP Applications
* Special Theme: Languages of Latin America

## NAACL 2024 Theme Track: "Languages of Latin America"

This is an exciting opportunity to explore and showcase the rich linguistic diversity of the region. 
For the call for papers on this theme, we expect authors to submit research contributions that focus on various aspects of language and computational linguistics within the context of Latin America. 
The special theme track "Languages of Latin America" aims to foster a deeper understanding of the linguistic landscape in the region and promote the development of language technologies that are culturally relevant and inclusive. 
We hope to receive innovative and insightful research papers that contribute to advancing computational linguistics in Latin America.

## ACL Rolling Review

NAACL 2024 will use [ACL Rolling Review](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp) (ARR) as a reviewing system, but final decisions will be made by the conference. 
Both submissions of articles for review and commitment of reviewed articles to the conference will be performed via the [Open Review](https://openreview.net) platform. 
Specifically, authors will follow a two-step process:

1. Authors submit articles to ARR, where submissions receive reviews and meta-reviews from ARR reviewers and action editors;
2. Authors commit their reviewed articles to a publication venue (e.g., NAACL 2024), where Senior Area Chairs and Program Chairs make acceptance decisions from the ARR reviews and meta-reviews.

NAACL 2024 has chosen this approach in coordination with the other *ACL 2024 conferences, which are adopting the same procedure and a coordinated submission plan to allow maximum flexibility during their submission periods for the authors. 
At each cycle an author must choose whether to have their paper under review at ARR, or committed to a conference. 
So for example, a paper submitted to ARR on 15 Dec 2023 cannot also be committed to EACL on their commitment deadline of 20 Dec 2023, but it could be either re-submitted to ARR on 15 Feb 2023 or committed to NAACL on 20 Feb 2023. 

The reviewing process will continue to be double-blind. Reviewers will not see authors nor will authors see reviewers, and reviews on ARR will not be made publicly visible. 
However, authors will be given the option through ARR to make their anonymized submitted articles publicly visible.

## Important Dates for NAACL 2024

**Anonymity period begins:** 1 month before submitting to the ACL Rolling Review, [following ARR CFP guidelines](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#anonymity-period).

**Paper submission deadline to ARR:** December 15, 2023

Papers submitted to ARR no later than December 15, 2023 will have reviews and meta-reviews by February 15, 2024, in time for the NAACL 2024 commitment deadline (see below). At submission time to ARR, authors will be asked to select one preferred venue (e.g., ACL 2024, NAACL 2024) to calculate the acceptance rate. However, selecting NAACL 2024 as a preferred venue does not require authors to commit to NAACL 2024.

**Commitment deadline for NAACL 2024:** February 20, 2024

Deadline for authors to commit their reviewed papers, reviews, and meta-review to NAACL 2024. It is not necessary to have selected NAACL as a preferred venue during submission.

**Notification of acceptance:** March 15, 2024

**Deadline for authors to withdraw papers from NAACL 2024 or Findings of NAACL 2024:** April 1, 2024

**Final version of papers due:** April 1, 2024

**Note:** All deadlines are 11:59PM UTC-12:00 ("anywhere on Earth").

## Paper Submission Details

Both long and short paper submissions should follow all of the [ARR submission requirements](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#paper-submission-information), including:

* [Long Papers](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#long-papers) and [Short Papers](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#short-papers)
* [Anonymity Period](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#anonymity-period) and [Instructions for Two-Way Anonymized Review](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#instructions-for-two-way-anonymized-review)
* [Authorship](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#authorship)
* [Citation and Comparison](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#citation-and-comparison)
* [Multiple Submission Policy](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#multiple-submission-policy), [Resubmission Policy](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#resubmission-policy), and [Withdrawal Policy](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#withdrawal-policy)
* [Ethics Policy](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#ethics-policy)
* [Limitations](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#limitations)
* [Paper Submission and Templates](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#paper-submission-and-templates)
* [Optional Supplementary Materials](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#optional-supplementary-materials-appendices-software-and-data)

Papers should be submitted to one of the [ARR 2023 submission sites](https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/ARR/2023).

Final versions of accepted papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 9 pages for long papers, up to 5 pages for short papers) to address reviewers’ comments.

## Presentation at the Conference

All accepted papers must be presented at the conference to appear in the proceedings. The conference will include both in-person and virtual presentation options. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for NAACL 2024 by the early registration deadline.

Long and short papers will be presented orally or as posters as determined by the program committee. While short papers will be distinguished from long papers in the proceedings, there will be no distinction in the proceedings between papers presented orally and papers presented as posters.
