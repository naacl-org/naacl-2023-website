# Instructions

Applicants should fill out **[the D&I Application form](https://forms.office.com/r/H3c54ZvxEi)** before **April 18th, 2024 11:59pm (AoE).**


# Information

NAACL 2024 is providing D&I funds for registration, caregiving, bandwidth, travel and VPN subsidies. We strongly encourage researchers from developing countries and marginalised communities, students, and researchers with financial hurdles to apply for both subsidies and volunteering opportunities to maximise their chances of getting their registration fees waived. Please apply for subsidies before **April 18th, 2024 11:59pm (AoE)**. 


# Registration and Membership subsidies

This is for getting a waiver for NAACL registration. You can also request ACL membership if applicable. You will be asked to justify your application. For instance, you can say: \
 \
1) _“I have an accepted paper at the main conference. I would like to apply for a registration fee waiver because my fees are not funded by my organisation/institution.”_

2) _“I have an accepted paper at an NAACL Workshop/ the WMT23 Shared Task/ NCI+NLP Workshop, I live in a developing country [name the country] and I/my institution cannot afford the registration fees. ”_

3) _“I have a paper accepted at the main conference/workshop/ and I am an active member of Latinx/Masakhane/North African in NLP/QueerinAI/WNLP.”_

Note that if you are applying for a registration fee waiver, you **SHOULD NOT register for the conference until you hear from us about your D&I subsidy application.** Keep in mind that we will take your justification into account when processing your application.


# Travel and accommodation subsidies

We are also providing travel and accommodation subsidies. Priority will be given to authors, first-time attendees and folks from underrepresented communities with financial hurdles.

If you would like to attend the in-person meeting, please keep in mind that if your waiver application is accepted, we are only able to pay in advance for some shared rooms at the conference hotel (the price needs to be included in the amount of money that you are requesting). Other accommodations and travel expenses (e.g., flight tickets) **can only be reimbursed after the conference.**

The number of accepted applicants and the amount of money subsidised will vary depending on the number of applicants and the funding availability. 

 \
Please answer questions regarding whether you have previously attended any *CL conferences (NAACL, EACL, AACL, ACL, EMNLP and COLING) accurately as we would like to give all first-time attendees a chance.


# Caregiving and accessibility subsidies

We can reimburse caregiving expenses needed at the time of the conference. You need to provide receipts for your expenses. These can be babysitting, transportation costs, or other support required for yourself or your dependents, which would ease your participation. If you need any personal or technical assistance to access and navigate the conference due to a disability, we can reimburse it (e.g.,  if you need assistance in using gather.town due to visual impairment). 

We acknowledge that accessibility needs are highly individual to each participant, so please feel free to reach out to us with any issues you might face in this regard. When justifying your caregiving and accessibility subsidy application, you can say for example: _“As a caregiver, I would like to apply for a subsidy of $$ USD to take care of my child when I will be presenting my work at the conference.”_


# Bandwidth and VPN subsidies 

We can reimburse bandwidth or VPN expenses (for those attending virtually) that you need for the conferences. You need to provide receipts for your expenses. Bandwidth subsidies would be for high-speed internet access costs for the **duration of the conference only**. VPN generally does not cost more than 10 USD per month and could be applied towards participation if you need anonymity to participate completely. A justification example can be:

1) “_I am from a remote village where I depend on my cellular internet. I would need $$ USD to increase my quote as my current plan is not suitable for video conferencing (add a link to the tariff of your internet subscriber if possible).”_

2) _“I worry about my safety and privacy because … and I would like to apply for a VPN subsidy of $$ USD to avoid surveillance (link to the service provider if possible).”_


# Selection Criteria 

Applications will be evaluated based on the submitted materials and provided justifications. Privacy will be respected and preference will be given to first-time attendees and applicants from underrepresented groups who are presenting a paper at the main conference or any of the workshops associated with NAACL, and those who do not have other means of support. 


# Application and Notification Deadlines 

All deadlines are 11:59 pm [UTC -12h](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zone/timezone/utc-12) (“anywhere on Earth”).

Application Deadline: **April 18th, 2024, 11:59pm  (AoE)**

Notification Deadline: **May 13--14, 2024, 11:59pm (AoE)**


# Notification of acceptance
