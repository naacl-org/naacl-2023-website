## Oral-Poster and Short-Long Equality

At NAACL 2024, we are striving to set all main conference papers on equal ground. So whether you submitted a long paper or a short paper, whether you decide to attend the event in-person or virtually, and whether you are assigned an oral presentation or a poster presentation, you are allowed the same 13 minute video recording on the virtual site. Similarly, we have not taken any actual or perceived measures of paper quality into account when making oral vs. poster presentation decisions, so there is no prestige associated with getting to present in an oral vs. a poster format.

## Main Conference vs Findings
There are two main differences between NAACL main conference papers and NAACL findings papers. The first is acceptance rate: main conference papers have a lower acceptance rate than findings papers. The second is registration: main conference papers will not be published unless at least one author pays full registration fees for the conference, while findings papers will be published even if no author registers for the conference.

To increase the visibility of NAACL Findings papers, authors who choose to attend the conference will be offered a poster presentation (either in-person or virtual, depending on how they attend). We hope this opportunity to showcase their work encourages more Findings authors to attend NAACL 2024!

## In-Person vs Virtual Attendance
At NAACL 2024, we are trying to improve both the in-person and virtual experiences. For this, we are implementing the following two actions:
1. A pre-conference virtual poster session that will be held on Thursday, June 13, 2024, avoiding conflicts with the conferenceâ€™s in-person sessions. We are still finalizing the schedule, but the virtual event will include different sessions to accommodate various time zones. We hope this move will encourage all attendees, both virtual and in-person, to join the virtual poster session!
2. Oral presentations will be in-person to avoid Zoom fatigue for in-person attendees. (Oral presentations will still be live-streamed for all virtual attendees.) We hope this move will encourage more in-person engagement with oral presenters!

## In-person attendees can expect access to:
- Live keynotes, plenaries, and panels
- More than 100 live oral presentations
- More than 400 live poster presentations
- More than 200 virtual poster presentations (at the pre-conference event)
- Recorded presentations for all papers (on the virtual conference site)


## Virtual attendees can expect access to:
- Live-streamed keynotes, plenaries, and panels
- More than 100 live-streamed oral presentations
- More than 200 virtual poster presentations (at the pre-conference event)
- Recorded presentations for all papers (on the virtual conference site)

We hope to see you all in Mexico City, in-person or virtually!
