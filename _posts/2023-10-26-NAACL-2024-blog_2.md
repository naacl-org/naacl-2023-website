We are excited that you are considering a submission to NAACL 2024! If this is your first time or if you need a refresher, here are some pointers to get you started. 

1. We are using the ACL Rolling Review (ARR) service, which is implemented on top of the OpenReview platform. All authors need an OpenReview account by submission time. Please make sure you and your co-authors have an OpenReview account sooner rather than later: [https://openreview.net/login](https://openreview.net/login). 
2. Here is a technical guide with screenshots so you know what to expect during the submission process: [Authors Guide to OpenReview](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Z2ZiQLLXrnzInVkwgeDjbAWjOFtbu2_uezKC_SZUPNU/edit#slide=id.p)
3. Why are EACL 2024, NAACL 2024, and ACL 2024 all using ACL Rolling Review? What is the difference between review and commitment? We highly recommend perusing the following two links: 

    a. [ARR submission dates and process for 2024 conferences](https://aclrollingreview.org/submission-dates-for-2024/)

    b. [A Crash Course on ACL Rolling Review Service](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaoCLEghXyU&t=2s)
 
To be considered for NAACL 2024, papers should be submitted to ARR no later than December 15, 2023. Reviews and meta-reviews will be available at the end of the 2-month ARR cycle for authors to decide whether to commit to NAACL 2024 (February 20, 2024 deadline). Please see the [CFP](https://2024.naacl.org/calls/papers/). If you have questions, please feel free to [email](naacl2024-programchairs@googlegroups.com) us!
