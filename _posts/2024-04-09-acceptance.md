<!-- The ACL Executive Committee has voted to change the Anonymity Policy. We suggest that authors read the [announcement](https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/report-acl-committee-anonymity-policy) to understand how this might impact your decisions with regard to your submission. To summarize:

- The new Anonymity Policy will apply to papers committed to NAACL on Feb 20, 2024. Under this new policy, submissions must still remain anonymous but there is no  anonymity period (so authors may post/discuss preprints if desired). 
- The new policy similarly applies to authors wishing to submit to the ARR February 2024 cycle.
- The original Anonymity Policy continues to apply to submissions reviewed under the ARR December 2023 cycle. For these submissions, the anonymity period remains in effect until the end of the cycle (Feb 15, 2024). After this time, it is allowable to post preprint versions of these submissions online, if desired. 

Some example scenarios of what is allowed now:
- Suppose you have a submission in the ARR December 2023 cycle. After Feb 15, 2024, you may post an online preprint under your name while also committing the paper to NAACL 2024 on Feb 20, 2024.
- Suppose you have a submission in the ARR October 2023 cycle or earlier. It is not in the ARR December 2023 cycle and you plan to commit to NAACL 2024. You may post an online preprint under your name at any time starting on Jan 12, 2024 (when the new policy is adopted). 

Note that, as before, papers committed to NAACL 2024 will remain anonymous and must be ARR submissions reviewed in an ARR cycle that completed before Feb 20, 2024. While there is an author rebuttal phase in the ARR cycle, the committed papers may not be revised. In the NAACL commitment site (which opens in early Feb 2024), authors will simply enter the URL of the ARR submission and a short (optional) message to the Senior Area Chairs of the NAACL conference. -->


We are happy to announce the list of papers accepted to NAACL 2024 Main Conference and Findings! In total, there are 565 papers accepted to the Main Conference and 304 papers accepted to Findings. The acceptance rate for Main Conference papers is 23%. For more details, read on. 


The acceptance rate calculation follows precedent set by previous conferences that also go through ACL Rolling Review (ARR), e.g. EACL 2023, NAACL 2022. The calculation takes into account the multi-stage process of ARR where a paper may get revised in ARR and then later committed to the conference. The denominator includes:
- Papers in the ARR December 2023 cycle that selected NAACL as a preferred venue
- Papers in the ARR December 2023 cycle that did not select any conference as preferred venue
- Papers in the ARR December 2023 cycle that selected another conference, but then committed to NAACL 2024. 
- Papers in the ARR cycles before December 2023 that committed to NAACL 2024. 

In total, we had 2604 submissions in the ARR December 2023 cycle. Among these, 29 were withdrawn before reviews were released and 115 were desk-rejected. Of the remaining, 2328 had either unspecified or included NAACL as the desired venue. Further, 17 out of the 132 submissions that selected other venues were committed to NAACL. Finally, an additional 89 papers from other cycles were committed. So in total, the denominator for acceptance rate calculation is 2328 + 17 + 89 = 2434. Among these, 1140 papers were officially committed to NAACL.

The acceptance rate for Main Conference papers is therefore: 565 / 2434 = 23.2%. The final Main Conference proceedings will include 487 long papers and 75 short papers (3 papers withdrew after the acceptance decision). 

Findings papers are those which are not accepted at the Main Conference, but nevertheless have been judged worthy of publication as “solid work with sufficient substance, quality and novelty” (see [EMNLP2020 blogpost](https://2020.emnlp.org/blog/2020-04-19-findings-of-emnlp)). The next 304 / 2434 = 12.5% of papers were accepted to NAACL Findings. The final Findings proceedings will include 255 long papers and 42 short papers (7 papers withdrew after the acceptance decision).
