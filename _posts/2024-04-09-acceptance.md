We are happy to announce the list of papers accepted to [NAACL 2024 Main Conference and Findings](/program/accepted_papers/)! In total, there are 565 papers accepted to the Main Conference and 304 papers accepted to Findings. The acceptance rate for Main Conference papers is 23%. For more details, read on. 


The acceptance rate calculation follows precedent set by previous conferences that also go through ACL Rolling Review (ARR), e.g. EACL 2024, NAACL 2022. The calculation takes into account the multi-stage process of ARR where a paper may get revised in ARR and then later committed to the conference. The denominator includes:
- Papers in the ARR December 2023 cycle that selected NAACL as a preferred venue
- Papers in the ARR December 2023 cycle that did not select any conference as preferred venue
- Papers in the ARR December 2023 cycle that selected another conference, but then committed to NAACL 2024. 
- Papers in the ARR cycles before December 2023 that committed to NAACL 2024. 

In total, we had 2604 submissions in the ARR December 2023 cycle. Among these, 29 were withdrawn before reviews were released and 115 were desk-rejected. Of the remaining, 2328 had either unspecified or included NAACL as the desired venue. Further, 17 out of the 132 submissions that selected other venues were committed to NAACL. Finally, an additional 89 papers from other cycles were committed. So in total, the denominator for acceptance rate calculation is 2328 + 17 + 89 = 2434. Among these, 1140 papers were officially committed to NAACL.

The acceptance rate for Main Conference papers is therefore: 565 / 2434 = 23.2%. The final Main Conference proceedings will include 487 long papers and 75 short papers (3 papers withdrew after the acceptance decision). 

Findings papers are those which are not accepted at the Main Conference, but nevertheless have been judged worthy of publication as “solid work with sufficient substance, quality and novelty” (see [EMNLP2020 blogpost](https://2020.emnlp.org/blog/2020-04-19-findings-of-emnlp)). The next 304 / 2434 = 12.5% of papers were accepted to NAACL Findings. The final Findings proceedings will include 255 long papers and 42 short papers (7 papers withdrew after the acceptance decision).
